Everything was in confusion in the O
blonskys' house. The wife had discov
ered that the husband was carrying o
n an intrigue with a French girl, wh
o had been a governess in their fami
ly, and she had announced to her hus
band that she could not go on living
 in the same house with him. This po
sition of affairs had now lasted thr
ee days, and not only the husband an
d wife themselves, but all the membe
rs of their family and household, we
re painfully conscious of it. Every 
person in the house felt that there 
was so sense in their living togethe
r, and that the stray people brought
 together by chance in any inn had m
ore in common with one another than 
they, the members of the family and 
household of the Oblonskys. The wife
 did not leave her own room, the hus
band had not been at home for three 
days. The children ran wild all over
 the house; the English governess qu
arreled with the housekeeper, and wr
ote to a friend asking her to look o
ut for a new situation for her; the 
man-cook had walked of the day befor
e just at dinner-time; the kitchen-m
aid, and the coachman had given warn
ing.  
Three days after the quarrel, Prince
 Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky--Stiva
, as he was called in the fashionabl
e world--woke up at his usual hour, 
that is, at eight o'clock in the mor
ning, not in his wife's bedroom, but
 on the leather-covered sofa in his 
study. He turned over his stout, wel
l-cared-for person on the springy so
fa, as though he would sink into a l
ong sleep again; he vigorously embra
ced the pillow on the other side and
 buried his face in it; but all at o
nce he jumped up, sat up on the sofa
, and opened his eyes.  
"Yes, yes, how was it now?" he thoug
ht, going over his dream. "Now, how 
was it? To be sure! Alabin was givin
g a dinner at Darmstadt; no, not Dar
mstadt, but something American. Yes,
 but then, Darmstadt was in America.
 Yes, Alabin was giving a dinner on 
glass tables, and the tables sang, I
l mio tesoro--not Il mio tesoro thou
gh, but something better, and there 
were some sort of little decanters o
n the table, and they were women, to
o," he remembered.
