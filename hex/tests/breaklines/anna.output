Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys' house. The wife had discovered that the husband
was carrying on an intrigue with a French girl, who had been a governess in their family, and she
had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with him. This
position of affairs had now lasted three days, and not only the husband and wife themselves, but
all the members of their family and household, were painfully conscious of it. Every person in the
house felt that there was so sense in their living together, and that the stray people brought together
by chance in any inn had more in common with one another than they, the members of the family
and household of the Oblonskys. The wife did not leave her own room, the husband had not been
at home for three days. The children ran wild all over the house; the English governess quarreled
with the housekeeper, and wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new situation for her; the
man-cook had walked of the day before just at dinner-time; the kitchen-maid, and the coachman
had given warning. 
Three days after the quarrel, Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky--Stiva, as he was called in the
fashionable world--woke up at his usual hour, that is, at eight o'clock in the morning, not in his
wife's bedroom, but on the leather-covered sofa in his study. He turned over his stout, well-cared-for
person on the springy sofa, as though he would sink into a long sleep again; he vigorously embraced
the pillow on the other side and buried his face in it; but all at once he jumped up, sat up on the
sofa, and opened his eyes. 
"Yes, yes, how was it now?" he thought, going over his dream. "Now, how was it? To be sure! Alabin
was giving a dinner at Darmstadt; no, not Darmstadt, but something American. Yes, but then,
Darmstadt was in America. Yes, Alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables, and the tables sang,
Il mio tesoro--not Il mio tesoro though, but something better, and there were some sort of little
decanters on the table, and they were women, too," he remembered.
